A project to analyse how varying the cache parameters can influence the performance of a
processor to great extents. The architecture used for analysis is X86 architecture. Also to
note the best suited parameters for each benchmark through analysis of hit rates, miss rates
and CPIs.

The 401_bzip2.zip and 458.sjeng.zip contains the test reports for different cache sizes on various benchmarks.
The Project1_SPEC-master.zip conatins the benchmarks on which analysis were done
